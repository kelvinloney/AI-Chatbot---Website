# AI CHATBOT & WEBSITE

## Chatbot

> I developed a ***mobile-first*** chatbot using ***HTML, CSS and JavaScript***, powered by the Google Gemini API. With an emphasis on the mobile experience, I incorporated a simple and intuitive interface optimized for smaller screens, while also employing API integration, data management, and responsive web design to ensure a seamless mobile experience.

## Website

> The accompanying ***responsive website***, designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, adjusts its layout and content to accommodate diverse screen sizes and devices, thereby providing a consistent and optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile, while images, icons, and other assets were edited with ***Photoshop***.
